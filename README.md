Pricing Layout Project
Overview
This project creates a responsive pricing layout with three pricing boxes, where users can select a pricing option by clicking a box. The selected box expands to show additional options (size and color selection), similar to the design provided in the reference image. The layout is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring compatibility across devices.
